🚀 Just Built My MERN Stack Project: Book Management App 📚
I'm thrilled to share my latest project built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This full-stack web app allows you to manage book records with features like adding, editing, deleting, and listing books with ease.


🛠️ Key Highlights:

📘 CRUD operations for books (BookName, Title, Author, Price, Date)

🔄 Dynamic list rendering and real-time updates

✅ Form handling and validation using React hooks

🔗 RESTful API integration with Axios

📁 Modular backend with Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose



---

💡 What I Learned:

Managing full-stack workflows from frontend to backend

Implementing clean API structures and controller logic

Handling user inputs, events, and state management in React

Building scalable, component-based UIs

🎯 This project is a big step in my journey to becoming a full-stack developer.
Would love to hear your feedback! Let’s connect and grow together 🌱
